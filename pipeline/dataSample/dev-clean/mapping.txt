1462-170142-0000.flac THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001.flac EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002.flac SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003.flac THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004.flac A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005.flac SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006.flac SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007.flac I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
1462-170142-0008.flac WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009.flac SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
1462-170142-0010.flac I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011.flac HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012.flac HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013.flac IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
1462-170142-0014.flac ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015.flac IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
1462-170142-0016.flac I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017.flac I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
1462-170142-0018.flac THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
1462-170142-0019.flac AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
1462-170142-0020.flac SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021.flac COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022.flac HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023.flac I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024.flac AFTER THE VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025.flac HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026.flac SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027.flac SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
1462-170142-0028.flac PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029.flac YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030.flac I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031.flac SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032.flac YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033.flac BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034.flac IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
1462-170142-0035.flac OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036.flac YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037.flac I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038.flac HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039.flac YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040.flac AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041.flac SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042.flac DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
